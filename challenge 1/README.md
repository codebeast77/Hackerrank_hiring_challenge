## Longest Even Length Word

Consider a string, sentence, of space-separated words where each word is a substring consisting of English alphabetic letters only.

We want to find the first word in sentence having a length which is both an even number and greater than or
equal to the length of any other word of even length in the sentence. 
For example, if sentence is `Time to write great code` , then the word we're looking for is Time .
While code and Time are of maximal length, Time occurs first. 
If sentence is `Write code for a great time` , then the word we're looking for is code.
